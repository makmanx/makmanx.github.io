<h2 style="width: 800px;">AMS Special Session on <i>Regularity Theory of PDEs and Calculus of Variations on Domains with Rough Boundaries</i> </h2><br>
Spring Eastern Sectional Meeting, April 13 - 14, 2019, University of Connecticut Hartford, Hartford, CT 

<p style="width: 900px;"> 
This session is focused on the regularity of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, 
and calculus of variations on domains with rough boundaries. 
In particular, we hope to focus on problems involving solvability 
of the second and higher order elliptic differential equations 
and systems in non-smooth media, free boundary problems, harmonic/elliptic/non-linear elliptic measures, 
analysis and PDEs on uniformly rectifiable sets, and regularity of free boundaries. 
Our hope is to share the recent developments in this area by bringing together 
mathematicians from different specialties whose work involves PDEs, harmonic analysis, 
geometric measure theory, and calculus of variations. We hope to particularly focus on graduate students and early career mathematicians 
in order to help to start future collaborations that will renew and refresh research in this fundamental area of analysis and PDEs.
