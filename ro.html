<h3>Research Opportunities</h3>

If you are interested in working on a problem related to <a href = "research.html" target = "frame2">my research</a>, contact me directly. 

<h4>PhD students</h4>

I am actively looking for PhD students to supervise on problems related to elliptic PDEs and their applications to funcational inequalities like Brunn-Minkowski inequalities and Minkowski type problems. These positions are subject to obtaining suitable funding. <br><br>

There are funding bodies that I have applied in the past to supervise PhD students at Essex and if you are interested to apply for one of these scholarship to do PhD, contact me directly.

<h4>Postdoctoral Researcher (PDRAs - known as Senior Research Officer)</h4>

Currently I am looking for a 2-year Postdoc (available from 30th of September 2022 until the 29th of September 2024) to work on problems related to linear and non-linear elliptic PDEs (Laplace and p-Laplace equations) and their applications in Minkowski-type problems and Brunn-Minkowski-type inequalities. <br>
